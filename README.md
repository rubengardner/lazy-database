# 🧰 Lazy Database CLI


## 🧠 What is Lazy Database?

Lazy Database is a lightweight, terminal-based TUI tool built in Go, designed to simplify your database interactions directly from the command line. Currently, it supports **PostgreSQL** with a flexible architecture that makes it easy to add support for other databases in the future.

This project is a work in progress, aiming to provide a clean, intuitive interface for browsing schemas, running queries, and managing data without ever leaving your terminal.
